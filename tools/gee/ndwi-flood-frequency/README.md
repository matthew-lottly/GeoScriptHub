# NDWI Flood-Frequency Mapper: Mississippi Delta
> Google Earth Engine script that pulls a multi-year Sentinel-2 time
> series, computes per-image NDWI, classifies water pixels, and
> produces a flood-frequency composite showing how often each pixel
> was inundated (0–100 %).

## Features

| Capability | Details |
|---|---|
| **Adjustable cloud cover** | `MAX_CLOUD_COVER` parameter (0–100 %) filters the S2 collection |
| **SCL cloud mask** | Removes cloud shadow, medium/high cloud, and cirrus via the Scene Classification Layer |
| **NDWI threshold** | `NDWI_THRESHOLD` is user-tuneable (raise for fewer false positives) |
| **Flood-frequency raster** | Per-pixel ratio of water observations to total clear observations |
| **Time-series chart** | Mean NDWI over time plotted in the console, shows seasonal cycles and anomalies |
| **Median NDWI composite** | Optional map layer for visual reference |
| **GeoTIFF export** | Commented-out `Export.image.toDrive` block ready to uncomment |
| **Zero dependencies** | Pure GEE JavaScript, paste into the Code Editor and click Run |

## Quick Start

1. Open the [Google Earth Engine Code Editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com/).
2. Create a new script and paste the contents of [`script.js`](script.js).
3. **(Optional)** Adjust the parameters at the top of the file:

 | Parameter | Default | Description |
 |---|---|---|
 | `MAX_CLOUD_COVER` | `20` | Max cloud cover % per image (increase ⇒ more images, noisier) |
 | `START_DATE` | `2019-01-01` | Time series start |
 | `END_DATE` | `2024-12-31` | Time series end |
 | `NDWI_THRESHOLD` | `0.1` | Pixel classified as water when NDWI ≥ this value |
 | `AOI` | Lower MS Delta polygon | Modify coordinates to move the study area |

4. Click **Run**.
5. The map will display:
 - **Flood Frequency (%)** (yellow = rarely flooded, blue = permanent water)
 - **Median NDWI**, toggled off by default
 - **Study Area**, red outline
6. Check the **Console** panel for the NDWI time-series chart and summary stats.

## How It Works

```
Sentinel-2 L2A Collection
  │
  ├─ filterBounds(AOI)
  ├─ filterDate(START_DATE, END_DATE)
  └─ filter(CLOUDY_PIXEL_PERCENTAGE < MAX_CLOUD_COVER)
  │
  ▼
Cloud Masking (SCL band)
  │  Remove classes 3 (shadow), 8/9 (cloud), 10 (cirrus)
  │
  ▼
Per-Image NDWI
  │  NDWI = (B3 − B8) / (B3 + B8)
  │
  ▼
Water Classification
  │  water = 1 if NDWI ≥ NDWI_THRESHOLD, else 0
  │
  ▼
Flood-Frequency Composite
  │  frequency = sum(water) / count(valid observations)
  │  Multiply by 100 → percentage
  │
  ▼
Visualisation
  ├─ Map: 6-colour YlGnBu flood-frequency raster
  ├─ Map: Median NDWI composite (optional)
  └─ Console: Mean NDWI time-series chart
```

### NDWI Formula
$$\text{NDWI} = \frac{B3_{\text{Green}} - B8_{\text{NIR}}}{B3_{\text{Green}} + B8_{\text{NIR}}}$$

- **NDWI > 0.3** → open water (lakes, permanent rivers)
- **NDWI 0–0.3** → mixed water or wet soil (tidal flats, shallow channels)
- **NDWI < 0** → land, vegetation, or bare soil

> **Tip:** The default threshold of **0.1** is slightly conservative for delta
> wetlands where shadows and turbid water push NDWI just above zero. Raise
> to 0.2–0.3 to focus on clearly open water; lower to 0.0 to capture every
> hint of moisture (more false positives in shadow zones).

### Flood Frequency
$$\text{Flood Frequency (\%)} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{water}_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{valid}_i} \times 100$$

Where $n$ is the number of images in the filtered collection,
$\text{water}_i$ is 1 if the pixel was classified as water in image $i$,
and $\text{valid}_i$ is 1 if the pixel was cloud-free.

## Study Area

The default AOI covers the lower Mississippi River Delta from the
birdfoot passes northward, roughly 10 miles inland from the Gulf coast:

| Corner | Latitude | Longitude |
|---|---|---|
| NW | 29.45° N | 89.95° W |
| NE | 29.45° N | 88.85° W |
| SE | 28.85° N | 88.85° W |
| SW | 28.85° N | 89.95° W |

This captures the three main distributary passes (Southwest Pass, South
Pass, Pass a Loutre), the surrounding marshlands, and the Head of
Passes junction.

## Colour Palette & Interpretation Guide

| Frequency | Colour | Hex | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 % | Light yellow | `#ffffcc` | High ground; never classified as water |
| ~17 % | Light green | `#c7e9b4` | Rare inundation; seasonal marsh margin |
| ~33 % | Aqua | `#7fcdbb` | Occasional flooding; backswamp / low levee |
| ~50 % | Teal | `#41b6c4` | Seasonal flooding; periodically inundated floodplain |
| ~67 % | Blue | `#2c7fb8` | Frequently inundated; semi-permanent wetland |
| 100 % | Dark blue | `#253494` | Permanent open water; main channel / bay |

## Reading the Time-Series Chart

The console chart plots **mean NDWI over the AOI** through time.
Here is what to look for:

| Pattern | What it means |
|---|---|
| Regular seasonal waves | Normal: wetter winters, drier summers |
| Sharp upward spikes | Flood events: hurricanes, extreme precipitation |
| Rising multi-year trend | Possible wetland expansion or land subsidence |
| Flat, no seasonality | Very arid AOI or insufficient cloud-free images |
| Gaps in the trace | Periods of persistent cloud cover, no clear images passed the filter |

---

## Exporting
Uncomment the `Export.image.toDrive` block at the bottom of the script
to save the flood-frequency raster as a 10 m GeoTIFF to your Google Drive:

```js
Export.image.toDrive({
  image: frequencyPct.clip(AOI).toFloat(),
  description: 'NDWI_Flood_Frequency_Mississippi_Delta',
  folder: 'GEE_Exports',
  region: AOI,
  scale: 10,
  crs: 'EPSG:4326',
  maxPixels: 1e10
});
```

> **QGIS tip:** Import the GeoTIFF and apply a Singleband Pseudocolour
> renderer with the same YlGnBu hex values to reproduce the GEE view exactly.

## Known Limitations

| Limitation | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Cloud-heavy regions** | Pixels under persistent cloud may have fewer than 5 valid observations. Frequency values will be noisy |
| **Shadow false positives** | Canals in deep forest shade can push NDWI near the threshold; SCL class 3 masking helps but is imperfect |
| **No SAR fusion** | Optical-only. Sentinel-1 SAR can supplement in persistently cloudy areas |
| **10 m pixel size** | Very narrow streams (< 10 m wide) may not be resolved as water pixels |
| **Static threshold** | A single global `NDWI_THRESHOLD` may need per-season or per-region tuning |
